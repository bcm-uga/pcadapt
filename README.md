R package {pcadapt} has been developed to detect genetic markers involved in biological adaptation. 
This package uses statistical tools for outlier detection based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

A tutorial for {pcadapt} is available on [pcadapt's website](https://bcm-uga.github.io/pcadapt/articles/pcadapt.html).

**News:** A new paper is finally out describing version 4 of pcadapt (which has been available for quite some time now). Please cite the new paper.
